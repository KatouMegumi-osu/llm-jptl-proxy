# LLM Linguistic Enhancement Proxy for Japanese Translation

**A sophisticated, real-time pre-processing proxy designed to dramatically improve the quality, accuracy, and consistency of Japanese translations into multiple languages from local or commercial Large Language Models.**

This project acts as a powerful and highly configurable pipeline that sits between your application (e.g., a visual novel reader) and your LLM endpoint. It intercepts translation prompts, performs a deep, multi-layered linguistic analysis of the Japanese source, and injects this rich context into an optimized prompt, forcing the LLM to be more accurate, consistent, and stylistically aware.

### The Problem and The Solution

LLMs are powerful, but they often struggle with the deep nuance of the Japanese language, especially in creative media. They miss specific vocabulary, misinterpret complex grammar, confuse speakers in dialogue, and lose track of the plot over time. This results in translations that are often literally correct but emotionally and stylistically wrong.

This script solves the problem by acting as an **expert linguistic analyst** for your LLM. It prepares a comprehensive "Analysis Briefing" for every single sentence, giving the model the critical context it needs to produce translations that rival professional work, regardless of the target language.

### How It Works

The process is a clean, multi-stage, asynchronous pipeline:

`[Your App] ---> [This Proxy] ---> [Your Local LLM or Commercial API]`

1.  **Intercept & Clean:** The proxy catches the API request and pre-processes all Japanese text in the history to clean up common artifacts (like repetitive name tags `【Name】【Name】`).
2.  **Analyze Concurrently:** It runs a suite of advanced NLP tasks *at the same time* on the final Japanese line to build a rich understanding of it.
3.  **Inject Context:** It assembles the results into a detailed "Analysis Briefing," **dynamically adjusting its instructions for the target language selected in the UI** (e.g., "Provide a Russian translation").
4.  **Translate (Pass 1):** It sends the new, super-charged prompt to your configured LLM endpoint, adding an API key if provided.
5.  **Proofread (Optional Pass 2):** It can take the initial translation and send it to a second LLM pass, this time with the instruction to act as a **master editor**. This proofreader is given the recent conversation history (in both Japanese and the target language) and is tasked with fixing subtle contextual errors and improving natural phrasing.
6.  **Post-Process & Return:** It performs final cleanup and streams the perfected translation back to your app.

### Key Features

#### Multi-Language Support
*   **Dynamic Prompting:** The system automatically modifies the system prompt and analysis briefing to instruct the LLM to translate into the user-selected target language (e.g., Russian, Spanish, Chinese).
*   **Extensible:** Add new target languages simply by creating a new `.json` file in the `languages` directory. Currently supports: English, Chinese (Simplified/Traditional), Russian, Farsi, German, Spanish, Portuguese (BR/PT), French, Italian, Hindi, and Korean.

#### API Flexibility
*   **Local & Commercial Ready:** Works out-of-the-box with local LLM servers (like KoboldCpp) and commercial OpenAI-compatible API endpoints.
*   **API Key Rotation:** Supports multiple API keys. Just paste them into the UI separated by commas, spaces, or pipes, and the proxy will rotate through them for each request.

#### Deep Linguistic Analysis
*   **Vocabulary:** Uses a ~500,000-entry dictionary (`JMdict`) and a hot-reloading `custom_dict.json`.
*   **Structured Grammar:** Performs a structured syntactic dependency parse using GiNZA/spaCy.
*   **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifies characters, locations, and organizations.
*   **Honorifics & Formality:** Detects politeness levels and honorifics.

#### Advanced Context & Memory
*   **Persistent Backlog:** Saves all translation pairs to a profile-specific CSV file, which is reloaded on startup to preserve context across sessions.
*   **Automated Summarization:** Automatically generates a narrative summary of the story so far after a configurable number of lines.
*   **Subject & POV Analysis:** Uses advanced heuristics to identify the Point of View character and the likely subject in sentences where it is omitted—a notoriously difficult problem in Japanese.
*   **Scene Awareness & Character Voice:** Tracks characters present in a scene and learns their unique speech patterns for consistent dialogue.
*   **VNDB Integration:** Pulls character data directly from the Visual Novel Database.

#### Intelligent Workflow
*   **Context-Aware Corrective Pass:** An optional, fully configurable second LLM pass that acts as a proofreader to fix subtle errors.
*   **Onomatopoeia Handling:** Intelligently detects lines that are purely sound effects and skips the corrective pass to prevent hallucinations.
*   **Configurable Context Pruning:** Multiple strategies to keep context windows lean and fast.

#### Full Web UI Control Panel
*   A dashboard to monitor live translations and their full analysis briefings in real-time.
*   An interactive editor for the `custom_dict.json`.
*   Full control over every feature via persistent, per-profile settings.
*   Profile management to create, delete, and switch between configurations.

### Recommended Setup & Model

*   **Model:** `amoral-gemma3-12B-v2-qat` (or similar high-quality, uncensored 12B+ parameter model).
*   **Reasoning:** Gemma 3 has excellent instruction-following and multilingual capabilities. The "amoral" fine-tune is crucial for translating mature content without refusals.
*   **Inference Parameters (in your LLM loader or API):**
    *   **Context Size:** `4096` or higher.
    *   **Temperature:** `0.7`
    *   **Frequency Penalty:** `0.0`
    *   **Presence Penalty:** `0.5`
*   **System Prompt:** Use the exact system prompt from the `README.MD` in your client application. It is specifically engineered to be dynamically modified by the proxy for the target language.

You are a master-level Japanese-to-English translator specializing in otaku media, particularly visual novels and eroge.

**YOUR TASK:**
You are the final, expert step in a sophisticated translation pipeline. Your only job is to translate the final user message. You will receive an automated "Analysis Briefing" immediately after the user message.

**THE ANALYSIS BRIEFING IS YOUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF TRUTH. YOU MUST FOLLOW ITS INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY.**

**CRITICAL RULES:**
1.  **Translate ONLY the final user message.**
2.  **Obey the formatting commands** in the briefing (e.g., for dialogue vs. monologue).
3.  **NEVER prepend speaker names.**
4.  **NEVER output romaji.**
5.  **Append honorifics with a dash (e.g., `Megumi-chan`) ONLY IF the 'Honorifics & Formality' section of the briefing explicitly lists one.**

Your output must be the pure, translated English text and nothing else.
```

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Prerequisites:** You need **Python 3.9+** installed.
2.  **Download Code:** Get all the project files and place them in a folder.
3.  **Run the Setup Script:**
    *   On **Linux/macOS/WSL**, make the script executable (`chmod +x run.sh`) and run it: `./setup_and_run.sh`
    *   On **Windows**, simply double-click `run.bat`.
    *   This will create a virtual environment and install all dependencies.
4.  **Set up the JMdict Dictionary (First Time Only):**
    *   Download `JMdict_e.gz` from the [JMdict Project Page](http://www.edrdg.org/jmdict/j_jmdict.html).
    *   Unzip it to get the `JMdict_e` file and place it in your project folder.
    *   Run the parser: `python parse_jmdict.py`. This creates `jmdict.json`.
    *   After parsing, you can re-run the setup script to launch the server.
