# LLM Linguistic Enhancement Proxy for Japanese Translation

**A (vibe coded and) sophisticated, real-time pre-processing proxy designed to dramatically improve the quality, accuracy, and consistency of Japanese-to-English translations from local Large Language Models.**

This project acts as a powerful and highly configurable pipeline that sits between your application (e.g., a visual novel reader) and your local LLM. It intercepts translation prompts, performs a deep, multi-layered linguistic analysis, and injects this rich context into an optimized prompt, forcing the LLM to be more accurate, consistent, and stylistically aware.

### The Problem and The Solution

Local Large Language Models are powerful, but they often struggle with the deep nuance of the Japanese language, especially in creative media. They miss specific vocabulary, misinterpret complex grammar, confuse speakers in dialogue, and lose track of the plot over time. This results in translations that are often literally correct but emotionally and stylistically wrong.

This script solves the problem by acting as an **expert linguistic analyst** for your LLM. It prepares a comprehensive "Analysis Briefing" for every single sentence, giving the model the critical context it needs to produce translations that rival professional work.

### How It Works

The process is a clean, multi-stage, asynchronous pipeline:

`[Your App] ---> [This Proxy] ---> [Your Local LLM]`

1.  **Intercept & Clean:** The proxy catches the API request and pre-processes the Japanese text to clean up common artifacts (like repetitive name tags `【Name】【Name】`).
2.  **Analyze Concurrently:** It runs a suite of advanced NLP tasks *at the same time* to build a rich understanding of the text.
3.  **Inject Context:** It assembles the results into a detailed "Analysis Briefing" and injects it into the prompt in a structured, attention-focusing format.
4.  **Translate (Pass 1):** It sends the new, super-charged prompt to your LLM for the initial translation.
5.  **Proofread (Optional Pass 2):** It can take the initial translation and send it to a second LLM pass, this time with the instruction to act as a **master editor**. This proofreader is given the conversation history and is tasked with fixing subtle contextual errors and improving natural phrasing.
6.  **Post-Process & Return:** It performs final cleanup (like removing prepended speaker names) and streams the perfected translation back to your app.

### Key Features

#### Deep Linguistic Analysis
*   **Vocabulary:** Uses a ~500,000-entry dictionary (`JMdict`) and a hot-reloading `custom_dict.json` to provide definitions for slang, onomatopoeia, and character names.
*   **Structured Grammar:** Performs a structured syntactic dependency parse using GiNZA/spaCy, identifying main clauses, subjects, objects, and conditionals to help the LLM with complex sentences.
*   **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifies characters, locations, and organizations.
*   **Honorifics & Formality:** Detects politeness levels (`desu/masu`) and honorifics (`-chan`, `-senpai`) to guide the LLM's tone.

#### Advanced Context & Memory
*   **Persistent Backlog:** Automatically saves all Japanese/English translation pairs to a CSV file for each profile. This history is reloaded on startup, ensuring context is never lost, even after a server crash.
*   **Automated Summarization:** To manage long-term context without overflowing the LLM, it automatically generates a narrative summary of the story so far after a configurable number of lines.
*   **Subject & POV Analysis:** Solves one of the hardest problems in Japanese translation by using heuristics to identify the Point of View character and the likely subject in sentences where it is omitted.
*   **Scene Awareness:** Keeps track of which characters are currently present in a scene.
*   **Character Voice Profiling:** Automatically learns and caches characters' unique speech patterns (like sentence enders and personal pronouns) to ensure their translated dialogue is always consistent.
*   **VNDB Integration (currently broken):** Pulls character names, aliases, and non-spoiler personality traits directly from the Visual Novel Database to enrich the context.

#### Intelligent Workflow
*   **Context-Aware Corrective Pass:** An optional second LLM pass that acts as a proofreader, using the conversation history to fix subtle errors and improve the natural flow of the initial translation. Fully configurable via the UI.
*   **Configurable Context Pruning:** Multiple strategies (prune Japanese, prune English, keep N turns) to keep context windows lean and fast.
*   **FOSS Machine Translation:** Uses a local Argos Translate model to provide a "first draft" reference for the main LLM.

#### Full Web UI Control Panel
*   A dashboard to monitor live translations and their full analysis briefings in real-time.
*   An interactive editor for the hot-reloading `custom_dict.json`.
*   Full control over every feature—from summarization triggers to granular analysis toggles—via persistent, per-profile settings.
*   Profile management to create, delete, and switch between configurations for different projects.

### Recommended Setup & Model

For the best results, it is highly recommended to use the following setup, which this proxy was designed to work with.

*   **Model:** `amoral-gemma3-12B-v2-qat` (or similar high-quality, uncensored 12B+ parameter model).
*   **Reasoning:** Gemma 3 has excellent instruction-following capabilities. The "amoral" fine-tune is crucial for translating eroge and other mature content without refusals. A 12B model fits comfortably in GPUs with 12GB+ of VRAM (e.g., RTX 3060 12GB).
*   **Inference Parameters (in your LLM loader):**
    *   **Context Size:** `4096`
    *   **Temperature:** `0.7`
    *   **Frequency Penalty:** `0.0` (Important! Let the proxy handle repetition).
    *   **Presence Penalty:** `0.5`
*   **System Prompt:** Use the exact system prompt from the `README.MD` in your client application. It is specifically engineered to work with the "Analysis Briefing" that the proxy injects.

You are a master-level Japanese-to-English translator specializing in otaku media, particularly visual novels and eroge.

**YOUR TASK:**
You are the final, expert step in a sophisticated translation pipeline. Your only job is to translate the final user message. You will receive an automated "Analysis Briefing" immediately after the user message.

**THE ANALYSIS BRIEFING IS YOUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF TRUTH. YOU MUST FOLLOW ITS INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY.**

**CRITICAL RULES:**
1.  **Translate ONLY the final user message.**
2.  **Obey the formatting commands** in the briefing (e.g., for dialogue vs. monologue).
3.  **NEVER prepend speaker names.**
4.  **NEVER output romaji.**
5.  **Append honorifics with a dash (e.g., `Megumi-chan`) ONLY IF the 'Honorifics & Formality' section of the briefing explicitly lists one.**

Your output must be the pure, translated English text and nothing else.

### Running the Application

1.  **Access the UI:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8001`.
2.  **Configure:** Use the web UI to set your LLM's API endpoint (`target_api_base_url`) and customize the toggles for your active profile. Click "Save Current Profile".
4.  **Update Your Client:** In your translation application, change the API endpoint to point to the proxy (e.g., `http://localhost:8001/v1/chat/completions`).

Enjoy the new standard of high-quality, real-time translation!
